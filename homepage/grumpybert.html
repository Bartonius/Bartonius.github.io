        <p><h1>The Ballad of GrumpyBert</h1></p>
           
        <p>When I think about the life cycle of small businesses in New York, the first name that comes to mind is GrumpyBert. GrumpyBert was my absolute favorite store when I was younger due to the fun plushies and paintings they sold. Back when I used to visit the store, I didn't always come there to buy something. Usually, I'd just be there to admire the cute little paintings and visit the store owner and his cute little pug Remmy. I got to learn a lot about the owner's life through those visits. I got to meet his newborn baby, I got to hear about the apartment he and his wife were trying to move into. He would always greet me with a very cheerful "Hi! Welcome!" every time I came in. We'd sometimes talk about the items in the store, such as the paintings and what we liked about them. To be honest, I probably didn't understand too well what he was talking about when he gave his interpretation of the art, as I was still a really little kid. Regardless, it was still nice to know more about him as a person. It was like we were old friends every time we talked, even if I didn't always have much to say.</p>
        <p>The difference between GrumpyBert and the rest of the stores around my neighborhood is that it had an exact kind of person it catered to, a very specific kind of person with a very specific aesthetic. You would think that a store would want to appeal to as many people as it possibly could to get more business. Most other stores in my area were either furniture stores or delis, places that could get a lot of business from the majority of people in the area. GrumpyBert was different in that it catered specifically to either people with children or out-and-out hipsters. The only people who came into the store had their kids with them, picking out stuffed animal food with eyes or very elongated plush cats, or they were teenagers picking up the cute little book titled All My Friends Are Dead. Those adults with kids probably were that type of teenager when they were that age, too. The best way to summarize the inventory of the store would be to look at the art on the walls. It was all beautifully drawn, but usually darkly whimsical, like a man in a cat suit sitting alone at a long dining room table. You didn't know exactly what the art was supposed to mean, but that was half the fun of it. It was just weird and you appreciated it for embracing that quality. GrumpyBert knew its audience, and its audience was me.</p>
        <p>GrumpyBert was a small store, and it was pretty cramped given all of the things in there, but it had a very specific atmosphere that made it one of my favorite places in all of New York. Walking in, you'd be hit by the comfortably cool air and clean smell of everything around you. Tables covered in small books and little decorations, quirky little stuffed animals piled onto shelves, and best of all, the paintings along the left wall. These paintings changed around every month, always depicting some cute character in a strange and surreal landscape. They were always my favorite thing in the store, and I wish I could have bought one when I still had the chance.</p>
        <p>It was only years later, after I'd grown up a bit and thought about it, that I realized that I never saw much change in GrumpyBert's inventory. The shelves were always almost completely full, covered in the same unusual stuffed animals that had always been there. The paintings cycled around each month, but for whatever reason they never seemed to sell, and I never saw any new ones come in. Even the books never changed. The store was absolutely full to the brim with its wares, but those wares never really left. Sometimes I wonder if I was the only customer, if the store only appealed to me and my family.</p>
        <p>I think the thing that probably caused GrumpyBert to go out of business was, unfortunately, the way in which it catered specifically to hipsters as opposed to a larger demographic. Though that store was really special to me, if you weren't the store's audience you probably didn't have a reason to go in and buy anything. That was probably the reason why I never saw more than a couple people in the store at once, people who I had seen in the store several times before. GrumpyBert's been gone for a few years now, and there isn't even anything to replace it. It's just an empty building. It's a shame; I would have liked to see something, anything come up in its place to give its disappearance a sense of meaning, but now there's just a metal garage door where my favorite store used to be.</p>
        <p>Maybe, in a way, it's nice to know that the inside of the building hasn't been changed much, other than being stripped of all GrumpyBert merchandise and being left to collect dust for years. Still, I'd like to see something show up there one day and bring new life into that empty spot. Maybe it'll fare better than the last store. Maybe I'll even like it more. The space that was GrumpyBert deserves that second chance.</p>
